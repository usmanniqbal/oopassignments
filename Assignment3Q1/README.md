Write the definition for a class named Vector2D that stores information about a two-dimensional vector. The class should
have functions to get and set the x and y components, where x and y are integers. Next, overload the * operator so that
it returns the dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two-dimensional vectors A and B is equal to
(A x * B x ) + (A y * B y ).
Finally, write a main subroutine that tests the * operation.
