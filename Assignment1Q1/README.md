# QUESTION # 01

Write a program that uses a class named **MovieData** to store the following information about a movie:
Title
Director
Year Released
Running time (in minutes)
Include a constructor that allows all four of these member data values to be specified at the time a **MovieData** variable
is created. The program should create two **MovieData** variables and pass each one in turn to a function that displays
the information about the movie in a clearly formatted manner.

Modify the Movie Data program written in Question#01 to include two additional members that hold the movie’s
production costs and first-year revenues. The constructor should be modified so that all six member values can be
specified when a **MovieData** variable is created. Modify the function that displays the movie data to display the title,
director, release year, running time, and first year’s profit or loss.
